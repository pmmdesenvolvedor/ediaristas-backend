## About this project

This project was developed during the Multistack free workshop from [TreinaWeb](https://www.treinaweb.com.br/), a very good development online school.

The **e-diaristas** project was divided in two parts: The backend (this one), and the frontend that can be found in [ediaristas-frontend repository](https://github.com/pmmdesenvolvedor/ediaristas-frontend).

This project will create a SQLite database to store the needed data. So, you have to uncomment the line `extension=pdo_sqlite` on your php.ini to permit connection.

See [ediaristas-frontend documentation](https://github.com/pmmdesenvolvedor/ediaristas-frontend/blob/main/README.md) to know how to integrate frontend and backend.

## Project purpose

ATENTION: This is not a commercial project!

This project was created during a workshop tod practice the exercises and learn about API development using Laravel PHP Framework and integration between frontend and backend.

Feel free to use this to modify as you study it.
